# Mobile App Design Assignment 5: Design a Soundboard

This application is a soundboard that can both play sounds as well as record and playback
user-created sounds

## How to use the application

Pressing a button will play its stored sound. In the case of recorded sounds, you must first
hold the button to record. Once released, the sound will then store itself and will play when
the button is pressed.
